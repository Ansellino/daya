      "Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park (Indonesian: Taman Budaya Garuda Wisnu Kencana), or GWK, is a tourist destination and attraction located at Ungasan, Badung on the island of Bali, Indonesia.It is devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu, and his mount, Garuda, the mythical bird who became his companion. Owned and managed by Alam Sutera Realty, Tbk, the construction of the 120.9-metre statue of Vishnu riding his mount Garuda was completed in August 2018.[citation needed] The park has a land area of about 60 hectares and is 263 metres above sea level.Designed to be Indonesiaâ€™s tallest statue, Garuda Wisnu Kencana was inspired by a story from Hindu history (not mythology) about the search for Amrita (the elixir of life). According to that, Garuda agreed to be ridden by Lord Visnu in return for the right to use the elixir to liberate his enslaved mother.The idea for the monument was not without controversy, and religious authorities on the island complained that its massive size might disrupt the spiritual balance of the island, and that its commercial nature was inappropriate, but some groups approve of the project, because it will be a new tourist attraction on barren land."

      "This landmark sculpture in Surabaya depicts a tussle for supremacy between a shark(Sura) and a crocodile(Baya) and is a symbol of Surabaya's strength. The statue holds special significance for the city of Surabaya, especially in light of the fact that the city got its name from the Javanese words for shark and crocodile, 'suro' and 'boyo' respectively. The two beasts are symbolic of the warring armies of Raden Widjaja and Tar Tar during 1293, after which Surabaya as a city was established."
